This file was designed to investigate how the modulus of elasticity of a dogbone sample changes under sinusoidal cyclic loading. Testing was completed using a CellScale univert. 

Ensure you download the entire repository and name your csv files correctly before running! A folder will be generated for each CSV file processed, containing a Stress-Strain curve for each loading cycle and an array containing the modulus of elasticity as calculated in each loading cycle. 

To use, simply download repo, place csv files in the active directory, and run the code :)
